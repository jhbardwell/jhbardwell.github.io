   <h2 id="Summary">Executive Summary</h2>
   <p>The purpose of this project is to create a fantasy narrative videogame that allows player agency to generate the story, blending old school adventure game with modern emergent systemic mechanics. These systemic mechanics, which include time-of-day, weather, location, and inventory, allow for an element of random variation when presenting the player with possible encounters. Unlike so many games that only provide the illusion of choice or weakly branching narratives, the core gameplay loop of "Five Minute Fantasy" is make a decision&rarr;get a reaction&rarr;suffer the consequence. The player is the main character in the storybook. What the player decides drives the story forward at the fundamental level, changing the text, graphics, and outcomes of various encounters.</p>
   <p>The encounter system can be likened to a classic quest system except that it is more granular, dynamic, and modular. Every decision-mediated consequence of the player is logged as an encounter. Prior encounters and current inventory items dictate player options during subsequent encounters. Player choice is the predominant&mdash;but not the only&mdash;factor driving this game. If a decision results in more than one possible encounter occurring, likelihood probabilities are applied depending on circumstance. In-game time is tied to the speed at which the player makes decisions: every choice advances time one-third of an hour. Weather patterns are random and tied to seasonality and time-of-day.</p>
   <p>You might be thinking that this sounds awfully similar to an immersive sim. While some sims use player choice to generate a limitiless multitude of branching paths and eliminate any coherent narrative altogether (a slice of life story: a la The Sims) and others constrain the narrative within a large branching storyline that uses player choice to select different branches (a novelesque story: a la Deus Ex, Fallout New Vegas, or The Witcher), this game follows a different strategy using a different story type. In "Five Minute Fantasy," the player is telling a short story in the form of a fantasy storybook, and the consequences of the choices they make define that story. The player is not merely following different predefined branches, pruning back that narrative tree with every step they take. Instead, the player is dynamically generating branching vectors as they go and from a single common node seed, growing their own unique tree.</p>
   <p>The play cycle of this game is short and sweet and right there in the name. Players get five minutes to experience their immersive adventure story (unless they die mid tale) after which time the game ends and displays the qualitative metrics of their accomplishments as lines on a histogram (a la Infinifactory), comparing what they did to what everyone else has ever done. This allows the player to not only craft their own narrative, but define their own win state. What constitutes a satisfying story is of a wholly individual perspective.</p>

   <h3 id="Setup">Setup</h3>
   <p>Adapting stories from literature to videogames warps mechanics for a passive audience, applying them to an active one using branching linear narratives disguised as choices.</p>
   <br>
   <h3 id="Problem">Problem</h3>
   <p>Videogame decision tree node event triggers typically only give the illusion of player agency, choice, and meaningful consequence, often snapping back to a linear narrative. This supposed active medium lacks both player participation and emergent game play.</p>

Re-merging is fairly common; backtracking rather less so. Quests generally involve some level of state-tracking. This mode is well-suited for journeys of exploration, focused on setting; the quest’s structure tends to be organised by geography rather than timee.

         <td> The game has a central thread of some kind, which loops around, over and over, to the same point: but thanks to state-tracking, each time around new options may be unlocked and others closed off. This is a very general pattern, and can co-exist with many others. Examples: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252330/DEATHLOOP/">Deathloop</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512890/Elsinore/">Elsinore</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/">Life is Strange</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/668770/Solarium/">Solarium</a></td>

   <h4 id="Selectionrationale">Selection Rationale</h4>
   <p>I chose to create my own small modest game engine&mdash;swallowing the extra up front time investiture to avoid the spiraling penalties of scope creep later imposed by a one-man project&mdash; as larger game engines are better suiter to more complex larger team projects. Using them on small projects invites perpetual scope creep. Smaller game engines would be more manageable, but did not align with my goals. I don't just want to make games; I want to make a system to make games. All the good systems develop their engines in-house. This maximizes creative solutions, adaptability, and flexibility (but beware more scope creep). Trying to bolt certain creative visions onto limited existing engines only results in pain. Does anyone recall the results of Ion Storm shoehorning the original Deus Ex into the Unreal Engine?</p>
   <p>I selected a blended narrative design. There is a story to be told. However, I place the details of its authorship in the hands of the player within the very broad bounds of lore and systemic effects created by the game designer.</p>
   <p>For the narrative structure, I chose a floating modular system. Of all the choices, only this one can solely exist within a computer game rather than being a tired pen-and-paper method crudely adapted to fit a computer game. Only this method creates a game that truly puts the player in the driver's seat rather than having them sit a passive passenger with the author behind the wheel. How could I resist such a challenge?</p>

   <h3 id="Playcycle">Play Cycle</h3>
   <p>The play cycle of this game is five minutes. It is designed to be endlessly replayable with customizable player choice-driven storylines and subjective win states. As such, there are no load or save functions.</p>
   <h3 id="Gameplayloop">Narrative Game Play Loop</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><b>1. Decision</b>: The player is presented by a choice and given a series of options displayed as text buttons. Those options are dictated by prior player choices, current player inventory, and in-game systemic elements.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>2. Reaction</b>: The perception and possible consequences behind making the choice are telegraphed by a change in animation and sound cues as the player hovers over each button to make their choice.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>3. Consequence</b>: Once the player selects and clicks a button, the choice is made, which then unlocks avenues of narrative progression in the form of a new decision opportunity that builds on those previously made.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>4. Repeat...</b></li>
   </ul>
   <p>This loop applies to all narrative elements: non player character progression, inventory item loss or acquisition, time progression, and changes in location.</p>

   <h3 id="Gamestates">Game States</h3>
   <h4 id="Menu">Main Menu</h4>
   <p>Game starts here by default. Offers the player an easily navigable portal to the game play, settings, and credits states.</p>
   <p>This is an "Intro" stage and as much onboarding as the player gets before throwing them into the fray. This is the first thing the player sees and with which they interact, revealing (or reaffirming) the game's core loop. As the player chooses a menu option, the adjacent static dragon logo changes and shoots flame at their selection before advancing them to their next choice. These events handily demonstrate the game in microcosm: decision, raction, consequences.</p>
   <p>The cursor icon is represented as a circular wax signet stamp. Radiobuttons are chosen by stamping them (with appropriate sound effect).</p>
   <br>
   <h4 id="Settings">Settings</h4>
   <p>Allows players to regulate the game's visuals and audio. Offers accessibility adjustment and multilinguistic features, catering to as wide and varied an audience as possible with no barrier to an enjoyable gameplay experience.</p>
   <p>This is a "Prep" stage. It allows the player to tailor the game environment to suit their individual preferences.</p>
   <p>The cursor icon is represented as a circular wax signet stamp. Radiobuttons are chosen by stamping them (with appropriate sound effect). Sliders are represented as knotted strings of twine, which are also stamped.</p>

   <p>Acknowledges all those who contributed in some way to creating this game. This includes artwork, music, layout design, programming, noteworthy beta testers, noteworthy kickstarter patrons, etc...</p>
   <p>This is an "Ancillary" stage. It allows the player to peruse extra content. Most folks will skip it.</p>
   <p>The cursor icon is represented as a trumpet. There are no selection options.</p>
   <br>
   <h4 id="Gameplay">Game Play</h4>
   <p>The core gameplay loop occurs here. The game redirects the story in real time based on the player's actions, advances at the pace of player's decisons, and ends before having met all the player's goals.</p>
   <p>This is the "Action" stage where players get to explore, immerse, interact, and read...lots of reading. This game is basically an interactive fantasy storybook simulation that casts the player as protagonist, author, and artist.</p>
   <p>What the player decides drives the story forward at the fundamental level, changing the text, graphics, and outcomes of various encounters. The encounter system can be likened to a classic quest system except that it is more granular, dynamic, and modular. Every decision-mediated consequence of the player is logged as an encounter. Prior encounters and current inventory items dictate player options during subsequent encounters. As the player dithers making their decision, the quill pen cursor icon will drip ink all over the page, obscuring the contents in a not-so-subtle visual reminder that the clock is silently ticking. Likewise, the inkwell in which the non moving quill is dipped slowly depletes as the game progresses towards a conclusion.</p>
   <p>Player choice is the predominant—but not the only—factor driving this game. Non player controlled factors include randomized game start time-of-day and season conditions; game progression systemic factors such as character location, item availability, item price, random encounters, weather patterns, and time progression; and game end conditions such as a game-mediated death consequence or the five minute time limit. If a decision results in more than one possible encounter occurring, likelihood probabilities are applied depending on circumstance. The rate of in-game time progression is directly tied to the speed at which the player makes decisions: every choice advances time one-third of an hour. Weather patterns are random and tied to seasonality and time-of-day.</p>
   <p>The cursor icon is represented as quill when either moving (bare quill) or not moving (bare quill dripping ink when hovering).  Actions are chosen by clicking on (writing) them.</p>
   <br>
   <h4 id="Victory">Victory</h4>
   <p>Players directed here after surviving for five minutes. Upbeat music plays. Displays comparative statistics as line (current play session) on histogram (all other play sessions) for various metrics</p>
   <p>This is a "Home" stage. It allows the player to relax, pause, and reflect before diving back into things...or just peruse one or two stats and dive back into things. The challenge-evoking community-oriented graphical leaderboard nature of the histograms also encourages the formulation of future goals and strategies while insidiously incentivizing just one more play session.</p>
   <p>Once the player decides to go again, game restart is lightning fast. Push a button. Back to square one. No main menu. No loading screen. BAM.</p>

   <p>The logo of the dragon poised to burn the title card&mdash;and indeed does so when the player hovers over one of the adjacent menu buttons, aiming to torch this human in their midst with a rather cheerful draconic grin&mdash;visually sets the stage for the core gameplay loop of decision&rarr;reaction&rarr;consequence.</p>

   <p>The player interacts with the world entirely through button press selections.</p>
   <h3 id="Graphics">Graphics Design</h3>
   <p>Graphics and animations are simple, stylized caricatures of either subverted or true-to-type fantasy archetypes. Colors are bold and primary. This makes images easier to create, manipulate, and reproduce and adds to the universal storybook tone the game is attempting to evoke</p>
   <h3 id="Audio">Audio Design</h3>
   <p>The gameplay soundtrack is upbeat, martial fantasy string and woodwind music with drums in the background. Composition mirrors a classic Freytag pyramid structure and ends at the five minute time-out mark. Variations on the theme and different songs to avoid repetition fatigue across multiple concurrent play cycles are pending. The menu, settings, and credit screens have a simpler cyclical soundtrack that shares a few string and drum lietmotifs. The victory condition music is rousing. The failure condition music is somber.</p>

   <h2 id="Postrelease">Post Release</h2>
   <p>Games wither and die on the vine without their creators encouraging and promoting active community involvement after the game is purchased. This keeps the lifeblood pumping, keeps the experience relevant, keeps the revenue flowing. Various strategies include subsequent DLC (XYZ), regular seasonal content (Fortnite), modding (DOOM or Skyrim), player game content creation (XYZ), active competition among players a la PvP or MMORPG mechanics (XYZ), or passive competition among players a la leaderboards or comparative histograms (Infinifactory). Other strategies used to keep an old game afloat in the churning flotsom of all those other games include brand awareness, cross-promotion, and franchise hype, which may or may not lead to inevitable sequels.</p>
