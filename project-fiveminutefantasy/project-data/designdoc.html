   <h2 id="Summary">Executive Summary</h2>
   <p>The purpose of this project is to create a fantasy narrative videogame that allows player agency to generate the story, blending old school adventure game with modern emergent systemic mechanics. These systemic mechanics, which include time-of-day, weather, location, and inventory, allow for an element of random variation when presenting the player with possible encounters. Unlike so many games that only provide the illusion of choice or weakly branching narratives, the core gameplay loop of "Five Minute Fantasy" is make a decision&rarr;get a reaction&rarr;suffer the consequence. The player is the main character in the storybook. What the player decides drives the story forward at the fundamental level, changing the text, graphics, and outcomes of various encounters.</p>
   <p>The encounter system can be likened to a classic quest system except that it is more granular, dynamic, and modular. Every decision-mediated consequence of the player is logged as an encounter. Prior encounters and current inventory items dictate player options during subsequent encounters. Player choice is the predominant&mdash;but not the only&mdash;factor driving this game. If a decision results in more than one possible encounter occurring, likelihood probabilities are applied depending on circumstance. In-game time is tied to the speed at which the player makes decisions: every choice advances time one-third of an hour. Weather patterns are random and tied to seasonality and time-of-day.</p>
   <p>You might be thinking that this sounds awfully similar to an immersive sim. While some sims use player choice to generate a limitiless multitude of branching paths and eliminate any coherent narrative altogether (a slice of life story: a la The Sims) and others constrain the narrative within a large branching storyline that uses player choice to select different branches (a novelesque story: a la Deus Ex, Fallout New Vegas, or The Witcher), this game follows a different strategy using a different story type. In "Five Minute Fantasy," the player is telling a short story in the form of a fantasy storybook, and the consequences of the choices they make define that story. The player is not merely following different predefined branches, pruning back that narrative tree with every step they take. Instead, the player is dynamically generating branching vectors as they go and from a single common node seed, growing their own unique tree.</p>
   <p>The play cycle of this game is short and sweet and right there in the name. Players get five minutes to experience their immersive adventure story (unless they die mid tale) after which time the game ends and displays the qualitative metrics of their accomplishments as lines on a histogram (a la Infinifactory), comparing what they did to what everyone else has ever done. This allows the player to not only craft their own narrative, but define their own win state. What constitutes a satisfying story is of a wholly individual perspective.</p>

   <h3 id="Setup">Setup</h3>
   <p>Adapting stories from literature to videogames warps mechanics for a passive audience, applying them to an active one using branching linear narratives disguised as choices.</p>
   <br>
   <h3 id="Problem">Problem</h3>
   <p>Videogame decision tree node event triggers typically only give the illusion of player agency, choice, and meaningful consequence, often snapping back to a linear narrative. This supposed active medium lacks both player participation and emergent game play.</p>

The elements of these branches have a modular structure: small, tightly-grouped clusters of nodes allowing many ways to approach a single situation, with lots of interconnection within each cluster and relatively little outside it. Re-merging is fairly common; backtracking rather less so. Quests generally involve some level of state-tracking. This mode is well-suited for journeys of exploration, focused on setting; the quest’s structure tends to be organised by geography rather than timee.

   <h4 id="Selectionrationale">Selection Rationale</h4>
   <p>I chose to create my own small modest game engine&mdash;swallowing the extra up front time investiture to avoid the spiraling penalties of scope creep later imposed by a one-man project&mdash; as larger game engines are better suiter to more complex larger team projects. Using them on small projects invites perpetual scope creep. Smaller game engines would be more manageable, but did not align with my goals. I don't just want to make games; I want to make a system to make games. All the good systems develop their engines in-house. This maximizes creative solutions, adaptability, and flexibility (but beware more scope creep). Trying to bolt certain creative visions onto limited existing engines only results in pain. Does anyone recall the results of Ion Storm shoehorning the original Deus Ex into the Unreal Engine?</p>
   <p>I selected a blended narrative design. There is a story to be told. However, I place the details of its authorship in the hands of the player within the very broad bounds of lore and systemic effects created by the game designer.</p>
   <p>For the narrative structure, I chose a floating modular system. Of all the choices, only this one can solely exist within a computer game rather than being a tired pen-and-paper method crudely adapted to fit a computer game. Only this method creates a game that truly puts the player in the driver's seat rather than having them sit a passive passenger with the author behind the wheel. How could I resist such a challenge?</p>

   <h3 id="Playcycle">Play Cycle</h3>
   <p>The play cycle of this game is five minutes. It is designed to be endlessly replayable with customizable player choice-driven storylines and subjective win states. As such, there are no load or save functions.</p>
   <h3 id="Gameplayloop">Narrative Game Play Loop</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><b>1. Decision</b>: The player is presented by a choice and given a series of options displayed as text buttons. Those options are dictated by prior player choices, current player inventory, and in-game systemic elements.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>2. Reaction</b>: The perception and possible consequences behind making the choice are telegraphed by a change in animation and sound cues as the player hovers over each button to make their choice.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>3. Consequence</b>: Once the player selects and clicks a button, the choice is made, which then unlocks avenues of narrative progression in the form of a new decision that builds on those previously made.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>4. Repeat...</b></li>
   </ul>
   <p>This loop applies to all narrative elements: non player character progression, inventory item loss or acquisition, time progression, and changes in location.</p>

   <h2 id="Aesthetics">Aesthetics</h2>
   <h3 id="Logo">Logo Design</h2>
   <p>The logo of the dragon poised to burn the title card&mdash;and indeed does so when the player hovers over one of the adjacent menu buttons, aiming to torch this human in their midst with a rather cheerful draconic grin&mdash;visually sets the stage for the core gameplay loop of decision&rarr;reaction&rarr;consequence.</p>   
   <h3 id="UI">User Interface Design</h3>
   <p>The player interacts with the world entirely through button press selections.</p>
   <h3 id="Graphics">Graphics Design</h3>
   <p>Graphics and animations are simple, stylized caricatures of either subverted or true-to-type fantasy archetypes. Colors are bold and primary. This makes images easier to create, manipulate, and reproduce and adds to the universal storybook tone the game is attempting to evoke</p>
   <h3 id="Audio">Audio Design</h3>
   <p>The gameplay soundtrack is upbeat, martial fantasy string and woodwind music with drums in the background. Composition mirrors a classic Freytag pyramid structure and ends at the five minute time-out mark. Variations on the theme and different songs to avoid repetition fatigue across multiple concurrent play cycles are pending. The menu, settings, and credit screens have a simpler cyclical soundtrack that shares a few string and drum lietmotifs. The victory condition music is rousing. The failure condition music is somber.</p>

   <ul>
      <li><b>browser engine (n)</b>: a program that transforms HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON files into static or dynamically displayed webpage content</li><br>
      <li><b>command pattern (n)</b>: a software design pattern that decouples the code which calls upon a function from the code which executes that function</li><br>
      <li><b>data-driven (adj)</b>: software whose structure and content are both softcoded using dom creation and data or databases, respectively</li><br>
      <li><b>dynamic (adj)</b>: software whose structure is hardcoded but content is softcoded and subject to dom manipulation</li><br>
      <li><b>frame rate (n)</b>: the speed (frames/second) by which static frames are advanced to provide the illusion of dynamic motion (that illusion fails below 12 fps). In film: 24 fps, videogames: 30 fps, and high end graphics games: 60 fps are the norm. Note that PC monitors run in multiples of 30 fps.</li><br>
      <li><b>rendering engine (n)</b>: a program that monitors and adjusts for changes in CPU run speed while presenting static text and images or dynamic animations, moving images, and particle effects made from arrays of static images. This is different from a time engine, which only affects in-game time.</li><br>
      <li><b>state machine pattern (n)</b>: a software design pattern that regulates the transition between two or more independently operating program states</li><br>
      <li><b>static (adj)</b>: software whose structure and content are both hardcoded and unchanging</li><br>
      <li><b>time engine/system (n)</b>: a systemic program that regulates, monitors, and advances in-game time, affects changes in temporal in-game variables, and may or may not monitor the effect of temporal on nontemporal variables. This is different from a rendering engine, which only affects real world and mechanism-based time</li><br>
