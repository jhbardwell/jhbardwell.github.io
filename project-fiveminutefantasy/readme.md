# ![About](/images/about.png)About 
This proof-of-concept narrative adventure rogue-lite project serves as a testbed to explore several ideas regarding narrative design graph theory, modern choose your own adventure game mechanics, random element interjection, player agency and consequence, and variable win state conditions. The core conceit is that after being thrown into a low fantasy setting, every choice the player makes opens and closes different options for each subsequent encounter and swiftly cuts down the clock. After making "five minutes" worth of decisions, the game ends whether a classical win condition has been achieved or not.
 
The temporal mechanic is something of a role reversal from most games that operate within set time limits. The player is not in a race to reach a finish line, but rather to experience as much as they can before the curtain falls. It's about the expanse of different stories unraveling with each new decision, not the final destination. And keeping the scope narrow allows for a rich, deeply layered player experience with high replay value.

Do you enjoy narrative based games, rollicking adventures, and low fantasy epics? Did you skip through those old choose your own adventure books to try and find the best elements to craft your own story from all the pieces strewn through those dog-eared pages? You ... do like dragons ... don't you?

Does your heart harken back to old school dungeons and dragons roguelikes such as Gauntlet and WazHack? Do you like your fantasy games with an actual challenge linked to a strong time mechanic a la Spelunky? Do you want to feel like your decisions matter to the larger text based narrative like Sorcery? Do your hectic schedule appreciate a satisfying, short play cycle? Then check out the "Five Minute Fantasy" demo! Given the current dearth of content, it's more like "Five Second Fantasy," but please give it a whirl regerdless.
