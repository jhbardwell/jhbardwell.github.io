        <p><b>1. Why I don't comment my code</b></p>
        <p>"Elegant code is like elegant dialogue," he said. Less is more. Exhaustive detail doesn't make things better, it's a crutch. Most comments are an excuse for incoherent, disorganized clutter. One should be able to read good code like the pages of a good book, never mind the footnotes. The sole exceptions are for cases of instruction or organization.</p>

        <p><b>2. What is my animus against frameworks and stock engines</b></p>
        <p>Other than that they both encourage bloated over-abstract code riddled with dependencies, stifle innovation in favor of one-size-fits-all conformity, and aggravate my contrarian dislike of trends, that's it. When the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, I will use them, but I don't rely on them.</p>

        <p><b>3. Why I quit being a professional scientist</b></p>

        <p> In short, I wanted to find a new career that better satiated both the logical and creative hemispheres of my brain. There's not much difference between the binary and biological arts. Both involve a precarious balance between problem solving content generation and interdisciplinary project management. Both involve generating and testing hypotheses, finding intriguing patterns in the world around us, and modeling complex systems using mathematical models.</p>

        <p><b>4A. My design management philosophy</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Never embrace the esoteric at the expense of the fundamentals: rule of three, colorwheel, etc</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>4B. My code management philosophy</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Each function should do one thing and one thing well</li>
            <li>In the tradeoff between fewer functions (optimize!) and more functions (specialize!), err towards the latter</li>
            <li>Nested if else statements are evil incarnate and nested for loops hordes of little demonspawn</li>
            <li>Split your code into bite sized interactive objects or modules--do not make a giant slimy block of spaghetti code lest you choke on it later</li>
            <li>Plan your code with the mindset that you will need to modify, rearrange, or update it someday</li>
            <li>If someone who does not know the language in which you are coding can still interpret the functionality of your code, you have succeeded</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>4C. My project management philosophy</b>
          <ul>
            <li>One or two group update meetings per week is quite enough of that folderol</li>
            <li>Pre and post production phases are important, damn it</li>
            <li>Debrief after every project to redress potential flaws in the next project</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>5. How I fill my spare time</b></p>
        <p>I enjoy crafting things with my hands, be it food (cooking), the precursors to food (gardening), or small tables on which to set that food (woodworking). I also write dark epic fantasies. You can check out my novels <a href="https://jeffreybardwell.com">here</a>.</p>
