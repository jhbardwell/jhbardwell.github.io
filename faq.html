        <p><b>1. Whence the gradual transition from ecologist to data scientist to software engineer?</b></p>
        <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/purity.png"
        alt="xkcd Webcomic showing derivative relationships among scientific disciplines" width=100% height=auto>
        <p> I wanted a career that satiates and better integrates the logical and creative hemispheres of my brain. Developing software satisfies that particular craving. There's not much difference between the binary and biological arts. Both involve research and innovation in their respective fields. Both maintain a precarious three way balance between problem solving, content generation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Both generate and test hypotheses, discover intriguing patterns in the world around us, and model complex systems using mathematics.</p>

        <p><b>2. What precisely did I do in my prior life?</b></p>
        <p>I am a classically trained natural historian, biostatistician, and community ecologist. I was an educator and research scientist, studying how abiotic and biotic systems interacted with eachother. Specific areas of exploration included dietary ontogeny, ectothermic metabolic regulatory behavior, nonlinear system modeling, and genetic landscapes.</p>

        <p><b>3. What sort of person am I?</b></p>
        <p>In my experience, people in an academic or business environment act like foraging song birds. I consider myself a robin with a generous helping of crow and a smidgeon of blue jay to temper the mix. Perhaps a bit of bunting in my dreams, but I tend to be too risk adverse. What sort are you?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Blue Jay</u>: Drown out others with your glorious voice. Push everyone aside with your mighty wings. Then claim your food.</li><br>
            <li><u>Bunting</u>: Where others see clearcut trees as ravaged desolation, you see an opportunity to advance into virgin territory.</li><br>
            <li><u>Cowbird</u>: Foist the responsibility of your fledgling ideas on others. Then lecture them on how you would have raised that chick.</li><br>
            <li><u>Crow</u>: Keep testing new methods to break that clam. Beak. Rock. Car tire. Gravity. The world is your toolbox.</li><br>
           <li><u>Magpie</u>: Get distracted by the newest shiny thing. Bring it back to your nest, discarding all others. Then shit on it.</li><br>
           <li><u>Robin</u>: Plan your worm hunt in detail. Rise early the next day to search the entire field. Agonize over which worm is the best.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <p><b>4. What is my project management philosophy?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Think all things through completely; solicit all input humbly; accept all feedback gracefully</li>
            <li>Establish unambiguous spheres of responsibility, a schedule, and concrete milestones for every task you seek to implement</li>
            <li>Planning, building, and managing the same task each require different mindsets and skillsets</li>
            <li>Debrief after every project to redress potential flaws in the next project</li>
            <li>Pre and post production phases are important...don't neglect them</li>
            <li>Encourage lower echelon ingenuity: upper level employees decide what needs to get done while lower level employees should be trusted to plan how and adapt that plan as needed</li>
            <li>While one group update meeting (i.e., stand meeting) per week is necessary, once per week is quite enough...and provide some comfortable chairs and a nice, round table</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>5. What are the differences between managing personal, academic, and business projects?</b></p>
        <p>The three main factors that account for the most limitations across all projects are time availability, financial resources, and meeting periodicity. Personal projects afford the most time while minimizing both finances and meetings. Academic projects provide less time, allow more resources, and require mid level meeting attandence. Business projects are afforded the least amount of time, but offer the most resources and require the most meeting attendence.</p>      
        <hr>
        <p><b>6. What are my thoughts on the iterative parallel project planning (i.e., agile) vs sequential series project planing (i.e., waterfall) debate?</b></p>
        <p>There should be more debate, actually. Agile has spread like kudzu, smothering everything that came before it. I support adaptation, but using a pure agile methodology and forsaking waterfall throws the baby out with the bathwater. Useful things like robust planning and evaluation stages, design documentation, and well-defined endpoints are tossed aside. Using a hybrid approach that takes the best from both worlds is better. So, I use waterfall for large scale project components like scheduling and agile for small scale components like feature development with a kanban-esque board intermediary.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>7. Why is the post project debrief so important?</b></p>
        <p>Many stop and pause before beginning a project to plan (i.e., kickoff meeting), but few likewise pause afterwards to reflect (i.e., after action debrief). This is a costly mistake. How can we improve subsequent projects if we do not address what worked and what did not&mdash;and more importantly discuss <u>why</u>&mdash;while the recent finished one is still fresh in our minds?</p>

        <p><b>8. What is my system design philosophy?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Follow the 7P's: Plan, Prototype, Playtest, Prove, Polish, Publish, Post</li>
            <li>Make your project accessible because not everyone sees, hears, or interprets symobls and stimuli the same way that you do</li>
            <li>Never embrace the esoteric at the expense of the fundamentals</li>
            <li>Create the mechanics first, the necessary functions second, and the aesthetics third</li> 
            <li>Build your product to flex and evolve</li>
            <li>Make it modular, then reuse your assets</li>
            <li>Decouple everything (i.e. separate concerns)</li>
            <li>Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify, simplify!</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>9. How do I avoid scope creep and endgame system bloat?</b></p>
        <p>I priotizize system feature implementation into three tiers&mdash;minimum, core, and wishlist&mdash;at the onset. Brainstorm and then prune heavily: most proposed features will (and should) be wishlisted. Then don't even glance at subsequent tiers until every feature in the prior one is designed, created, tested, and polished.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>10. Who is the best author for system design documentation?</b></p>
        <p>Everyone! Each individual working on a proposed system needs to contribute their input on its design. Such documents should always be short, adaptable, and collaborative.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>11. Why is designing for accessibility so important?</b></p>
        <p>Not only does designing for a wide and varied user base allow you to court a larger audience, you also take advantage of positive unintended consequences (i.e., the curb cut effect). Making your program easy to ue and dynamically adjustable to suit different needs will cast beneficial ripples beyond the intended core audience.</p>

        <p><b>12. What is my code writing philosophy?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Hardcode as little as possible</li>
            <li>Always favor composition over inheritance</li>
            <li>Give your variables and functions descriptive names</li>
            <li>Make that name categorization intuitive, simple, and consistant</li>
            <li>Each function should do one thing and one thing well</li>
            <li>In the tradeoff between fewer functions (optimize!) and more functions (specialize!), err towards the latter</li>
            <li>Nested if else statements are evil incarnate, nested for loops hordes of little demonspawn, and if/elseif chains their intruments of doom</li>
            <li>Split your code into independently testable bite sized chunks&mdash;do not make a giant slimy block of spaghetti code lest you choke on it</li>
            <li>Plan with the mindset that you or someone else will need to modify, rearrange, or update this code someday</li>
            <li>If someone who does not know the language in which you are coding can still interpret what your code is supposed to do, you have succeeded</li>

        <p><b>13. What programming markups/scripts/languages have I learned, why did I study them, and how did I use them?</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><u>C++</u>: I shallow dove into C++ in graduate school (2009) as part of my coursework to teach us programming fundamentals. It was more of a belly flop, actually. I dove deeper years later during the Covid pandemic (2020) to rehone those fundamentals and experiment with game development and SDL graphics.</li><br>
          <li><u>CSS</u>: I perused style sheets years ago to make simple webpages (2002). I later augmented that knowledge to learn responsive design and simple animation effects.</li><br>
          <li><u>HTML</u>: I dabbled in HTML in college (2001) to create static webpages at the dawn of the internet. The web has advanced much faster than my hypertext markup skills. I also started using it to send out weekly newsletters (2017). I have recently delved deeper into esoterica such as canvas (2021).</li><br>
          <li><u>JavaScript</u>: I initiated my JavaScript journey during the Covid pandemic (2021) after growing dissatisfied with Python and C++ to create cross platform interactive programs that were universally accessible. This handily dovetailed into dynamic webpage and SPA design.</li><br>
          <li><u>Markdown</u>: I started learning Markdown (2021) to update my comprehensive program documentation. I had previously used&mdash;and am still in the midst of converting&mdash;txt files for that purpose.</li><br>
          <li><u>Mermaid</u>: I devoured Mermaid (2022) after getting over my thrill that such wonder and magic existed on this earth. Anyone who has ever labored with Excel or Powerpoint to produce or modify clunky business-oriented charts, graphics, and schedules will understand my elation. Well, now we can dynamically code and style those using a sweet CLI.</li><br>
          <li><u>Python</u>: I began Python on my own in graduate school (2010) to build a GUI program to predict unnknown bacteria colony isolate strains using binary biochemical test results and contriwise display the expected test results of known isolates using a searchable database. The program could also filter for confounding variables such as collection environment, growth media, and incubation temperature. I later used those skills in a professional capacity to develop software for a startup company (2020)</li><br>
          <li><u>R</u>: I learned R for my graduate school courses (2008) to sort big datasets, conduct multivariate analyses, and create manuscript graphics. I used those skills to successfully defend my dissertation (2013). I then taught R to my own students as a lecturer at a small university (2015).</li><br>
          <li><u>ShellScript</u>: I picked up ShellScript and bash commands using Linux distros for personal (Fedora - 2013) and later professional (Ubuntu - 2015, 2020) use. This was after a childhood spent using DOS, which has a similar syntax and purpose. However, I am hardly fluent.</li><br>

        <p><b>14. How do I fill my spare time when I am not managing, designing, or coding projects?</b></p>
        <p>It's important not to define life by your job. I enjoy making things with my hands such as small woodworking projects. I like cooking, baking, and brewing. I maintain a small garden of savory herbs, sweet assorted berries, and tasty greens. I also make my own fun acting in community theatre, reading prodigiously, writing dark epic fantasy novels, and designing games.</p>

        <p><b>15. What are my future plans?</b></p>
        <p>Finding remote employment designing, developing, and/or managing biology, educational, narrative, interactive, and/or GUI software is a priority. Adding php to my language roster and diving into backend web development and server database information retrieval is at the top of my list. I have a fun idea for a gamified kanban board I'm currently iterating. I also want to finish actualizing some of my better game design documentation into larger module-based programs using HTML canvas.</p> 
        <p>Expanding and upgrading my garden into hugelkultur raised beds would be worthwhile. I also need to finish one of my series of novels and branch into audiobook production. The future holds plenty of promise and, hopefully, a bigger slice of the cottage pie!</p>

        <p>Of course, the secret to any recipe is in the presentation on the page. A good recipe invites comments in the margins. It reveals the unique experience of the chef who crafted their reality in such an engaging way that everyone who reads those words can share that experience, recontextualize it, and make it their own. So...how do you like your pie?</p>
