        <p><b>1. Why I don't comment my code</b></p>
        <p>"Elegant code is like elegant dialogue," he said. Less is more. Exhaustive detail doesn't make things better, it's a crutch. Most comments are an excuse for incoherent, disorganized clutter. One should be able to read good code like the pages of a good book, never mind the footnotes.</p>

        <p><b>2. What is my animus against frameworks and stock engines</b></p>
        <p>Other than that they both encourage bloated over-abstract code riddled with dependencies, stifle innovation in favor of one-size-fits-all conformity, and aggravate my contrarian dislike of trends, that's it. When the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, I will use them, but I don't rely on them.</p>

        <p> There's not much difference between the binary and biological arts. Both involve generating and testing hypotheses, finding intriguing patterns in the world around us, and modeling complex systems using mathematical models. In short, I wanted to find a new career that better satiated both the logical and creative hemispheres of my brain.</p>

        <p><b>4. How I fill my spare time</b></p>
        <p>I enjoy crafting things with my hands, be it food (cooking), the precursors to food (gardening), or small tables on which to set that food (woodworking). I also write dark epic fantasies. You can check out my novels <a href="https://jeffreybardwell.com">here</a>.</p>
