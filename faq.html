        <p><b>1. Whence the gradual transition from ecologist to data scientist to software engineer?</b></p>
        <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/purity.png"
        alt="xkcd Webcomic showing derivative relationships among scientific disciplines" width=100% height=auto>
        <p> I wanted a career that satiates and better integrates the logical and creative hemispheres of my brain. There's not much difference between the binary and biological arts. Both involve research and innovation in their respective fields. Both maintain a precarious three way balance between problem solving, content generation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Both generate and test hypotheses, discover intriguing patterns in the world around us, and model complex systems using mathematics.</p>

        <p><b>2. Why do I rarely comment my code?</b></p>
        <p>"Elegant code is like elegant dialogue," he said. Less is more. Exhaustive detail doesn't make things better, it's a crutch. Most comments are an excuse to handwave disorganized code, ambiguous variable names, or overcomplex functions. One should be able to read good code like the pages of a good book, never mind the footnotes. The sole exceptions are for cases of instruction or categorical organization.</p>

        <p><b>3. What is my system design philosophy?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Follow the 7P's: Plan, Prototype, Prune, Playtest, Polish, Publish, Post</li>
            <li>Make your project accessible because not everyone sees, hears, or interprets symobls and stimuli the same way that you do</li>
            <li>Never embrace the esoteric at the expense of the fundamentals</li>
            <li>Fully develop the core mechanics first, the minimal necessary functions second, and the aesthetics third...then and only then glance at that shiny new features wishlist</li> 
            <li>Build your product to flex and evolve</li>
            <li>Make it modular, then reuse your assets</li>
            <li>Decouple everything (i.e. separate concerns)</li>
            <li>Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify, simplify!</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>4. What is my code writing philosophy?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Hardcode as little as possible</li>
            <li>Always favor composition over inheritance</li>
            <li>Give your variables, functions, and classes descriptive names</li>
            <li>Each function should do one thing and one thing well</li>
            <li>In the tradeoff between fewer functions (optimize!) and more functions (specialize!), err towards the latter</li>
            <li>Nested if else statements are evil incarnate, nested for loops hordes of little demonspawn, and if/elseif chains their intruments of doom</li>
            <li>Split your code into independent bite sized chunks&mdash;do not make a giant slimy block of spaghetti code lest you choke on it</li>
            <li>Plan your code with the mindset that you will need to modify, rearrange, or update it someday</li>
            <li>If someone who does not know the language in which you are coding can still interpret what your code does, you have succeeded</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>5. What is my project management philosophy?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Think it through completely; solicit input humbly; accept feedback gracefully</li>
            <li>Establish unambiguous spheres of responsibility and milestones for all tasks</li>
            <li>Planning, building, and managing the same task each require different mindsets and skillsets</li>
            <li>Debrief after every project to redress potential flaws in the next project</li>
            <li>Pre and post production phases are important, damn it...don't neglect them</li>
            <li>Encourage lower echelon ingenuity: upper level employees decide what needs to get done while lower level employees should be trusted to plan how and adapt that plan as needed</li>
            <li>While one group update meeting (i.e., stand meeting) per week is necessary, once per week is quite enough</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>6. How do I fill my spare time?</b></p>
        <p>I enjoy crafting things with my hands, be it food (cooking), the precursors to food (gardening), or small tables on which to set that food (woodworking). I also write dark epic fantasy novels and design games.</p>
