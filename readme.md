# ![About](/images/about.png)About 
A frontend demonstration website requires meeting&mdash;and in the best-case scenario wildly exceeding&mdash;certain standards regarding documentation, design, content, layout, image preloading, form validation, project data presentation, and user accessibility. Aesthetics and system design considerations must be balanced with practical and elegant code. Across the hierarchy of mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics, a creation is judged by the user experiences it generates and those impressions reflect upon the one who created it. This is my creation.
